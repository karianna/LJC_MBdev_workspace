		// Add more kinds of Animal such as Rabbit, Lion, Elephant
		
		// Add a new hierarchy of classes for various kinds of Vehicle (or use Car, Bus & Bike classes from D04b_Inheritance2 if you prefer)
		
		// People can buy certain kinds of Animal and certain kinds of Vehicle, which we will designate "Buyable".
		// For something to be Buyable it must have a price and a buy() method, so add these to the Buyable interface.
		// Choose which Animals and Vehicles should implement the Buyable interface eg class car extends Vehicle implements Buyable.
		
		// Add to your Person class an array of Buyable called favourites, and an addFavourites() method.
		// In your main() method create and add a variety of favourites, then write a loop to calculate their total cost
